1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

* - Expression 
'hello' = Value
-87.8 = Value
- = Expression
/ = Expression
+	= Expression
6 = Value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

String: String is a data type that can contain a set of characters, number, etc.
Variable: A reserved memory location to store the data is called a variable

3. Describe three different data types.

Strings, Intergers, Complex Numbers, Floating Point Numbers, Boolean, etc.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, 
that evaluates to a single value.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Bacon would still contain 22 as its value.

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam' = spamspamspam
'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

A variable name should always being with a character and not an interger. Hence, 100 will be considered an invalid variable name.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

To get an integer, "int" is to be used.
To get an floating-point number, "float" is to be used.
To get an string, "str" is to be used.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

Here, we are trying ton concatenate a string with an interger. Since the data types are different, it causes an error.
In order to fix this, we will have to convert the integer data type to string like shown below, which would give the desired output.

'I have eater' + str(99) + 'burritos.'
